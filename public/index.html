      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          👋 Welcome to your React app’s HTML template!

          This file is the base structure for your project.
          If you open it directly in a browser, you’ll just see a blank page —
          the real content is automatically injected by React when the app runs.

          💡 To start developing:
            → npm start  (or yarn start)

          🚀 To build your production version:
            → npm run build  (or yarn build)

          You can customize this page too:
          add web fonts, meta tags, a favicon, or analytics as you like.

          Happy coding ✨
